About Me

My name is Natalia Berrios and I am a rising junior. Furthermore, I'm currently a member of Girls Who Code. In which I, alongside other girls close in age, learn how to code.

First Side Scroller

Every week, we work on a project related to coding. As our first group project we were required to create a side scroller game from scratch, using a website called Sctratch. Scratch is a website designed to help those new to computer science to learn the basics of coding in a fun and easy way. Perfect for a beginner like me, but creating a game for the first time was still challenging. Nevertheless, the teachers were very patient and with the help of my fellow female companions, we were was able to complete the task. My group had a underwater theme; in which an octopus has to escape from sharks heading its way, whilst catching fish to accumulate points.

7/19/17: Reflection 

Similarities b/w Python and Sctratch: Variables, "Definition blocks", and loops are used in a similar way.
Difference: Python is much more complicated and detail oriented. 

It was very frustrating debugging the code because even the tiniest detail, such as quotations and semicolons that were misplaced, caused the code not to work. Also, trying to figure the issue got complicated especially if your code wasn't organized. However, it was a fun challenge and I enjoyed working with a partner.
