      My name is Natalia Berrios and I am a rising junior. Furthermore, I'm currently a member of Girls Who Code. <br>
      In which I, alongside other girls close in age, learn how to code.</p>


<h2>First Side Scroller</h2>
<p> Every week, we work on a project related to coding. As our first group project we were required to create <br>
  a side scroller game from scratch, using a website called Sctratch. Scratch is a website designed to help <br>
  those new to computer science to learn the basics of coding in a fun and easy way. Perfect for a beginner <br>
  like me, but creating a game for the first time was still challenging. Nevertheless, the teachers were <br>
  very patient and with the help of my fellow female companions, we were was able to complete the task. <br>
  My group had a underwater theme; in which an octopus has to escape from sharks heading its way, <br>
  whilst catching fish to accumulate points. </p>
